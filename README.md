# JavaScript Function with Limited Operation Handling

This repository demonstrates a simple JavaScript function with limited operation handling. The `calculate` function performs addition and subtraction, but lacks robust error handling for unsupported operations. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` offers an improved version.

## Bug Description
The original `calculate` function only handles 'add' and 'subtract' operations.  Providing any other operation results in a simple string message. This is a common issue, better exception handling or more specific error reporting would improve the code's robustness.
